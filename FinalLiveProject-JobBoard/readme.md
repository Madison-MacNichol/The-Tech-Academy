### Live Project
***

My final project for the tech academy was a 2 week sprint building out this website:

https://jobpdx.com/Home

Tasks:
- Page styling & content (Jobs page & All Companies page)
- Data entry & database management
- Cleaning up code (consolidating syling into CSS files)
- Page creation (FAQ page & content)
- Carousel functionality (Home page)

This project was done on a team of fellow studnets, where the tasks were devided according to choice and skill set. It has been in the works for many months with many contributions from former students before me. That being said, it was challenging at times to navigate the code (hence cleaning it up was necessary) and work off what was already there. At the end of the sprint, the team had completed 12 userstories addressing various aspects.
