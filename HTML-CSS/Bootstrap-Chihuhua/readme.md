### Learning how to use Bootstrap
***

#### Objective

This project was wto design a webpage for an animal service salon using bootstrap's grid system.

#### Steps Taken

Step 1: Creating containers
Step 2: Creating rows
Step 3: Creating columns
Step 4: Utilizig multiple class selectors
Step 5: Offsetting Columns, Nesting rows & Using the Push/Pull command


#### Outcome
I had some issues with the version in the video vs. the current version I was using. Most notably to link to other files in the latest verson of Bootstrap, double periods are needed (..). Additionally I found it difficult to nest rows without bothering all nearby rows. The project was successful although as it was my first, I think it took much longer than usual.
