### C# Final Drill
***
#### Purpose

To create a simple program using Microsoft Visual Studio. I choose to build a single page application grocery list.

#### Method

Internet research, code writing, trial and error, more core writing, more trial and error, confusion, mumbling, going for walks to clear my thoughts...repeat. 

This project also uses JavaScript & HTML. Because the drill was intended to demonstrate ability, I did not put additional time into aesteic styling. This is a pity and I intend to spruce it up in the future!

#### Result

This program will not be winning any fashion awards, but it's functional, and I am proud to own it as my first C#/Visual Studio creation on my own.
