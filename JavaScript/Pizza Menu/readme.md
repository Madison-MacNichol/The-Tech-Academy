### JavaScript Final Drill
***
### Purpose

To create a dynamic pizza menu (because all programmers love pizza I guess?? :/ ) using HTML, CSS & JavaScript using Notepad++.

### Method

The HTML was written first according to perameters we were given for the assignment, followed by the CSS, then JavaScript. Lots of Googling and Stack Overflowing and consulting more seasoned classmates was involved.

### Result

It works! I can now successfully design any pizza I like (even a dessert pizza!) and dream about it being delivered to my door. One minor stying issue remains, which unfortunately due to a time constraint I was unable to reslove, but by golly the thing works!
