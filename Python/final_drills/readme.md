### Python Final Drills
***
#### Purpose
To create single task programs using Python in IDLE 3.6.2. The most fun and interesting one for me was the date/time drill. It is a simple program whose output displays weather a business is currently open or not in another time zone.

#### Method
Internet research, code writing, trial and error, more core writing, more trial and error

#### Result
All three single task programs completed their tasks as desired.
